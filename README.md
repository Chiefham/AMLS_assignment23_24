A/:

DNN.model: Saved DNN model .

LeNet5.model: Saved LeNet5 model.

MobileNetV2.model: Saved MobileNetV2 model.

Model_KNN: Saved KNN model.

Model_RF: Saved RF model.

Model_SVM: Saved SVM model.

DL_train_eva.py: It contains a class which has three main 
methods LeNet5(), MobileNetV2(), DNN() to call. Each method 
requires no input and has no return value. When a method is called, 
the corresponding deep learning model will be built and trained 
and evaluated, and the model will be saved. This file provides 
the code implementation of the deep learning model for task A.

ML_train_eva.py: It contains a class which has three 
main methods SVM(), RF(), KNN() to call. Each method requires 
no input and has no return value, when the method is called, 
the corresponding machine learning model will be built and 
trained and evaluated, and the model will be saved. 
This file provides the 
code implementation of the machine learning model for task A.

GridSearchCV_KNN.py: Use the GridSearchCV() function to 
tune the hyperparameters of the KNN model to find the combination of 
hyperparameters that will allow the model to perform best.

GridSearchCV_RF.py: Use the GridSearchCV() function to 
tune the hyperparameters of the RF model to find the combination of 
hyperparameters that will allow the model to perform best.

GridSearchCV_SVM.py: Use the GridSearchCV() function to 
tune the hyperparameters of the SVM model to find the combination of 
hyperparameters that will allow the model to perform best.

data_loader.py: Load the data.

--------------------------------
B/:

DenseNet201.model: Saved DenseNet201 model

MobileNetV2.model: Saved MobileNetV2 model

ResNet152V2.model: Saved ResNet152V2 model

VGG19.model: Saved VGG19 model

DL_train_eva.py: It contains a class which 
has four main methods to call inside the class, 
VGG19(), MobileNetV2(), DenseNet(), ResNet152V2(). 
Each method requires no inputs and has no return values, 
when the method is called, the corresponding deep learning 
model will be built and trained and evaluated, and the model 
will be saved. This file provides 
the code implementation of the deep learning model for Task B

data_loader.py: Load the data

-----------------
Datasets/: An empty folder to store the datasets

-------------------
main.py: A main function that can directly call the built classes 
and methods to train, evaluate and store the model.
